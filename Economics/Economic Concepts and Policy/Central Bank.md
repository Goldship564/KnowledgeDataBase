A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages the currency and monetary policy of a country or monetary union.[1] In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base. Many central banks also have supervisory or regulatory powers to ensure the stability of commercial banks in their jurisdiction, to prevent bank runs, and in some cases also to enforce policies on financial consumer protection and against bank fraud, money laundering, or terrorism financing.

Central banks in most developed nations are institutionally independent from political interference,[2][3][4] even though governments typically have governance rights over them and legislative bodies exercise scrutiny.[5][6]

Issues like central bank independence, central bank policies and rhetoric in central bank governors discourse or the premises of macroeconomic policies[7] (monetary and fiscal policy) of the state are a focus of contention and criticism by some policymakers,[8] researchers[9] and specialized business, economics and finance media.[10][11]
