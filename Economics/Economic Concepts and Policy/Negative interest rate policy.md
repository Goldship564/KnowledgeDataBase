A negative interest rate policy (NIRP) is an unconventional [[Monetary Policy]] tool employed by a central bank whereby nominal target interest rates are set with a negative value, below the theoretical lower bound of zero percent.
#### KEY TAKEAWAYS

- A negative interest rate policy (NIRP) occurs when a central bank sets its target nominal interest rate at less than zero percent.

- This extraordinary monetary policy tool is used to strongly encourage borrowing, spending, and investment rather than hoarding cash, which will lose value to negative deposit rates.
