## The objective

The objective of monetary policy is to preserve the value of money by keeping inflation low, stable and predictable. This allows people to make spending and investment decisions with more confidence, encourages longer-term investment in the economy, and contributes to sustained job creation and greater productivity. This in turn leads to improvements in our standard of living.
