## Overview

The 2023 [[International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America|United Auto Workers (UAW)]] [[Labor Strike|strike]] is an ongoing labor strike involving automobile workers in the labor union United Auto Workers (UAW) and the three unionized automakers in the United States—Ford Motor Company, General Motors, and Stellantis. These three automakers' factories combined employ about 145,000 UAW members and produce about 50 percent of the vehicles manufactured annually in the US, accounting for 1.5 percent of US GDP.[3][4] The strike began on September 15, 2023, when the union was unable to reach a deal with the three automakers. It is the first trilateral strike against the three automakers in the union's history.

The hardline stance taken by the newly elected UAW president Shawn Fain contributed to the UAW's decision to strike. In particular, he has criticized stagnant wages that do not account for inflation and has called for the end of a tiered employment system that underpays newer employees, the restoration of overtime and retirement benefits that were lost as a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, the institution of a four-day workweek, and improved worker protections against plant closures as electric vehicle production increases.

A central concern for the automakers is the cost of labor relative to domestic and foreign non-union competitors, particularly as the industry transitions to electric vehicle manufacturing.[5] The automakers have stated that they anticipate the need to invest a significant portion of their profits from gasoline-powered vehicles into new production technology for electric vehicles.[6] 

## Historical Strike
This was the first time all three of Detroit’s legacy automakers were struck at the same time, a bet by UAW President Shawn Fain to keep them guessing by incrementally adding more plants to the work stoppage. His strategy is paying off with record wage hikes and the restoration of some benefits that the union forfeited during the financial crisis more than a decade ago.
