Sergio Pietro Ermotti (born 11 May 1960) is a Swiss manager and investment banker. [1] In April 2021, Ermotti was elected Chairman of Swiss Re, one of the world's largest reinsurance companies, succeeding Walter Kielholz. He was the Group Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of [[UBS Group AG]] from November 2011 to October 2020 and regained that position in 2023. [2]

Ermotti took over as Group CEO at UBS after the 2011 rogue trader scandal, implementing strict corporate policies governing community standards. He initiated a major restructuring of the bank, redefining strategy, putting wealth management and Swiss business at its centre, alongside asset management and a more focused and capital-light investment banking. Leading the firm for nearly a decade, he was the longest serving head of UBS.[3][4] In February 2020, UBS announced that Ralph Hamers, CEO of ING Group, would be succeeding Ermotti as Group CEO on 1 November 2020. Following the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS, Ermotti was appointed to lead the UBS Group again, replacing Hamers on 5 April 2023.[5]

It has been speculated that he might transition into [[Swiss Confederation|Swiss]] politics after his career in banking.[6] He ruled out entering select political races for the Bundesrat stating that he was "not a politician".[7] In addition to English, Ermotti speaks Italian, German, and French fluently.
