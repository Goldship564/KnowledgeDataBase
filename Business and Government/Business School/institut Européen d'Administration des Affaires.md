INSEAD, a contraction of "Institut Européen d'Administration des Affaires" (lit. 'European Institute of Business Administration'),[8] is a non-profit graduate business school that maintains campuses in France, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, and the United States. Its degree programmes are taught in English and include a full-time Master of Business Administration (MBA), an Executive MBA (EMBA), and executive education programmes.

INSEAD admits no more than 12% of students of the same nationality.[9] It frequently appears on rankings of the best business schools such as QS World and the Financial Times. Its MBA has produced the second-most number of CEOs of the world's 500 largest companies, behind Harvard Business School,[10] and the sixth most billionaires.[11] INSEAD is among the top 20 universities globally that produced most of the world's ultra high-net-worth individuals.[12][13]
