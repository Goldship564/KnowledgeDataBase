China Central Television (CCTV; Chinese: 中国中央电视台; pinyin: Zhōngguó zhōngyāng diànshìtái) is a national television broadcaster of [[People's Republic of China|China]], established in 1958 as a propaganda outlet. Its 50 channels broadcast a variety of programming to more than one billion viewers in six languages.[2][3] CCTV is operated by the National Radio and Television Administration which reports directly to the [[Communist Party of China (CPC)]] (CCP)'s Central Propaganda Department.[4][5][2]

CCTV has a variety of functions, such as news communication, social education, culture, and entertainment information services. As a state television station it is responsible to both the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council.[6] It is a key player in the Chinese government's propaganda network.[7][1] According to Freedom House and other media commentators, CCTV's reporting about topics sensitive to the Chinese government and CCP is distorted and often used as a weapon against the party's perceived enemies.[7][8]
