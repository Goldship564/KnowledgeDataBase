## Overview
The People's Bank of China (officially PBC[3] or informally PBOC;[4] Chinese: 中国人民银行) is the [[Central Bank]] of the [[People's Republic of China]], responsible for carrying out [[monetary policy]] and regulation of financial institutions in China,[note 1] as determined by the People's Bank Law and the Commercial Bank Law. It is the 25th-ranked cabinet-level executive department of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]].

The PBC was established in 1948 with the merger of the Huabei Bank, the Beihai Bank and Northwestern Farmers' Bank. After the proclamation of the PRC in 1949, it became the nation's central bank. In 1969, the PBC was demoted to a bureau of the Ministry of Finance, an arrangement that lasted until August 1979. The PBC was extensively reformed during the 1990s, when its provincial and local branches were abolished, instead opening nine regional branches. These reforms were reversed in 2023, when the regional branches were abolished and the provincial branches restored.

Though operating with some autonomy, the PBC lacks central bank independence, and is required to implement the policies of the [[[Communist Party of China (CPC)|Chinese Communist Party (CCP)]]]. The PBC is led by a governor, assisted by deputy governors, and the CCP Committee Secretary; both posts are currently held by Pan Gongsheng.
