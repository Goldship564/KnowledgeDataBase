Alibaba is one of the world's largest retailers and e-commerce companies. In 2020, it was also rated as the fifth-largest artificial intelligence company.[12] It is also one of the biggest venture capital firms and investment corporations in the world, as well as the second largest financial services group behind Visa via its fintech arm Ant Group. The company hosts the largest B2B (Alibaba.com), C2C (Taobao), and B2C (Tmall) marketplaces in the world.[13] It has been expanding into the media industry, with revenues rising by triple percentage points year after year.[14] It also set the record on the 2018 edition of China's Singles' Day, the world's biggest online and offline shopping day.[15]
