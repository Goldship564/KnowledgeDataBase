Emirates (Arabic: طَيَران الإمارات DMG: Ṭayarān Al-Imārāt) is one of two flag carriers of the [[United Arab Emirates]] (the other being Etihad). Based in Garhoud, Dubai, the airline is a subsidiary of The Emirates Group, which is owned by the government of Dubai's Investment Corporation of Dubai.[4] As of 2019, it was also the largest airline in the Middle East,[5] operating over 3,600 flights per week from its hub at Terminal 3 of Dubai International Airport. It operates to more than 150 cities in 80 countries across all continents (except Antarctica) through its fleet of nearly 300 aircraft.[6] Cargo activities are undertaken by Emirates SkyCargo.[7]

Emirates is the world's fourth-largest airline by scheduled revenue passenger-kilometers flown.[8] It is also the second-largest in terms of freight tonne-kilometers flown.

During the mid-1980s, Gulf Air began to cut back its services to Dubai. As a result, Emirates was conceived on 15 March 1985, with backing from Dubai's royal family, with Pakistan International Airlines giving two of the airline's first aircraft. With $10 million in start-up capital, it was required to operate independently of government subsidy.[9] Pakistan International Airlines provided free training facilities to Emirates' cabin crew at Karachi airport.[9] The airline was headed by Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the airline's present chairman. In the years following its founding, the airline expanded both its fleet and its destinations. In October 2008, Emirates moved all operations at Dubai International Airport to Terminal 3.[10]

Emirates operates a mixed fleet of Airbus and Boeing wide-body aircraft and is one of the few airlines to operate an all-wide-body aircraft fleet (excluding Emirates Executive[11]). As of March 2023, Emirates is the largest Airbus A380 operator with 100 aircraft in service, 19 in storage and two aircraft having been scrapped.[12][13] Since its introduction, the Airbus A380 has become an integral part of the Emirates fleet, especially on long-haul, high-density routes. Emirates is also the world's largest Boeing 777 operator with 134 aircraft in service.[14]
