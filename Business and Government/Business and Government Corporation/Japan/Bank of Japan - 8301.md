### Background information

Like most modern Japanese institutions, the Bank of Japan was founded after the [Meiji Restoration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meiji_Restoration "Meiji Restoration"). Prior to the Restoration, Japan's feudal fiefs all issued their own money, _[hansatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrip_of_Edo_period_Japan "Scrip of Edo period Japan")_, in an array of incompatible denominations, but the _New Currency Act_ of Meiji 4 (1871) did away with these and established the [yen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yen "Yen") as the new decimal currency, which had parity with the Mexican silver dollar.The former [han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_(Japan) "Han (Japan)") (fiefs) became [prefectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefectures_of_Japan "Prefectures of Japan") and their mints became private chartered banks which, however, initially retained the right to print money. For a time both the central government and these so-called "national" banks issued money. A period of unanticipated consequences was ended when the Bank of Japan was founded in Meiji 15 (10 October 1882), under the Bank of Japan Act 1882 (27 June 1882), after a Belgian model. It has since been partly privately owned (its stock is traded over the counter, hence the stock number)

### Trail of Monetary Policy 

In 1999, the BOJ started zero-[[Interest Rate|interest rates]] policy (ZIRP), but they ended it despite government opposition when the IT bubble happened in 2000. 

However, Japan's economic bubble burst in 2001 and the BOJ adopted the balance of current account as the main operating target for the adjustment of the financial market in March 2001 (quantitative relaxation policy), shifting from the zero-interest-rate policy. 

From 2003 to 2004, Japanese government did exchange intervention operation in huge amount, and the economy recovered a lot. In March 2006, BOJ finished quantitative easing, and finished the zero-interest-rate policy in June and raised to 0.25%.

In 2008, the financial crisis happened, and Japanese economy turned bad again. BOJ reduced the uncollateralized call rate to 0.3% and adopted the supplemental balance of current account policy. In December 2008, BOJ reduced uncollateralized call rate again to 0.1% and they started to buy Japanese Government Bond (JGB) along with commercial paper (CP) and corporate bonds. 

In 2013, the head of the BOJ (Kuroda) announced a new quantitative easing program (QE). This program would be very large in terms of quantity, but it would also be different in terms of quality—qualitative easing (QQE). In other words, the BOJ would (and did) also purchase riskier assets like stocks and REITs.
In 2016, the BOJ initiated [yield curve control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_Curve_Control "Yield Curve Control")

In 2016, the BOJ started its negative interest rates policy (NIRP).
