[[Canada ]]Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC; French: Société canadienne d'hypothèques et de logement, SCHL) is Canada's federal crown corporation responsible for administering the National Housing Act, with the mandate to improve housing by living conditions in the country.[2][3]

Originally established after World War II to help returning war veterans find housing,[3][4] it has since seen its mandate expand to the mandate of improving access to housing overall.[5]
