## Mission

We are the only ones doing what we do in [[Canada]]: stimulate the Canadian economy by helping SMEs succeed in all sectors of activity. Our mission leads us to see further, to do things differently. We support and encourage our employees to renew themselves, through a rich culture and strong programs. The result is clear; the team is second to none, with a way of doing things based on our expertise in the financial field, all carefully executed thanks to our listening skills and to our unrivalled business vision.

Each of us uses our knowledge to support business owners in all industries and stages of their development from business centres across Canada and online on BDC.ca.

What defines us:

- We are committed to the long-term success of our entrepreneurs, and we understand that there is more to business than just numbers.
- We play a critical and complementary role to that of private sector financial institutions and have been serving Canadian SMEs since 1944.
- We evolve as a financially viable and reliable Crown corporation. Our operations are at arm's length from our sole shareholder, the Government of Canada.

## Impact

We measure our impact by its reach and effect on the continuing growth of the Canadian economy: we support thousands of business owners, every day. Over the past 75 years, our dedicated and experienced team has grown to 2,900 employees, helping more than 100,000 business owners realize their full potential and more.

At BDC, it is all about evolving in a healthy, skills-rich work environment that puts forward the best conditions for shaping unique teams where the power to act is real and has impact.

Our head office in Montreal is an exciting place to be (find out for yourself!). The employment opportunities and our services are available across Canada, allowing you to choose a location that suits you best.

## Shareholder

As a commercial Crown corporation, BDC has only one shareholder: the Government of Canada.

We believe in adhering to the highest standards of sound corporate governance practices, which is why we are governed by an entirely independent Board of Directors.

_Again, we are banking at another level._
