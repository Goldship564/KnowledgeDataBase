## Who runs BoC
### The Govening Council
The Governing Council leads the Bank. As our policy-making body, it is responsible for:

- conducting [[Monetary Policy]]
- promoting a safe and efficient financial system

The Governing Council is made up of the Governor, the Senior Deputy Governor and the Deputy Governors.

The Governing Council's main tool for conducting monetary policy is the policy interest rate. This rate is normally set on eight fixed announcement dates per year. The Council reaches its decisions about the rate by consensus—rather than by individual votes, as is the case at some other central banks.


### The Executive Council

The Executive Council is made up of the Governing Council, the Chief Operating Officer and the Executive Director – Supervision. Together, they chart the strategic direction of the Bank.


### The Governor

As our Chief Executive Officer, the Governor ultimately has full control over the business of the Bank. The Governor:

- chairs the Board of Directors
-  leads our Governing Council
-  conducts monetary policy to achieve an inflation target agreed upon by the Bank and the Government of Canada

Our Governor must be a Canadian citizen with experience in international finance and a thorough understanding of financial markets and the economy.

The Board of Directors appoints the Governor:

- according to eligibility requirements in the Bank of Canada Act
-  for a seven-year term, to allow the medium- and long-term perspective essential for effective monetary policy
-  with the approval of the Governor in Council (the federal Cabinet)

### The Senior Deputy Governor

Overseeing the Bank’s strategic planning and operations, our Senior Deputy Governor:

- shares responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy as a member of the Bank’s Governing Council
- is a member of the Bank’s Board of Directors
- is appointed by the Board of Directors for a seven-year term

## How we’re separate from the political process

The Bank of Canada is a special type of Crown corporation, owned by the federal government, but with considerable independence to carry out its responsibilities.

- The Governor and Senior Deputy Governor are appointed by the Bank's Board of Directors (with the approval of Cabinet), not by the federal government.
- The Deputy Minister of Finance sits on the Board of Directors but has no vote.
- We submit our expenditures to our Board of Directors, whereas federal government departments submit theirs to the Treasury Board.
- Our employees are regulated by the Bank itself, not by federal public service agencies.
- Our books are audited by external auditors appointed by Cabinet on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance, not by the Auditor General of Canada.

An independent monetary institution separates the power to spend money from the power to create money.

As a central bank separate from the political process, we are able to adopt the medium- and long-term perspectives essential to conducting effective monetary policy.
