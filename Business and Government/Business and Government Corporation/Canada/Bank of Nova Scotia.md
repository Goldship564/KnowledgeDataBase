The Bank of Nova Scotia (French: Banque de Nouvelle-Ã‰cosse), operating as Scotiabank (French: Banque Scotia), is a Canadian multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. One of [[Canada]]'s Big Five banks, it is the third-largest Canadian bank by deposits and market capitalization. It serves more than 25 million customers around the world and offers a range of products and services including personal and commercial banking, wealth management, corporate and investment banking. With more than 92,001 employees and assets of Can$1,136 billion (according to 2020 annual report), Scotiabank trades on the Toronto (TSX: BNS) and New York (NYSE: BNS) exchanges. The Scotiabank swift code is NOSCCATT and the institution number is 002.[3]

Scotiabank was founded in 1832 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where it was headquartered until relocating to Toronto in 1900.[4] Scotiabank has billed itself as "Canada's most international bank" due to its acquisitions primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean, and also in Europe and parts of Asia. Scotiabank is a member of the London Bullion Market Association and one of fifteen accredited institutions which participate in the London gold fixing.[5] From 1997 to 2019, this was conducted through its precious metals division ScotiaMocatta.[6]

Scotiabank's president and CEO Brian J. Porter[7] announced his retirement to be effective January 31, 2023, and Scott Thompson was named as his replacement.[8]
