The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is the largest transportation agency of the [[United States of America|U.S.]] government and regulates all aspects of civil aviation in the country as well as over surrounding international waters.[3]: 12, 16  Its powers include air traffic control, certification of personnel and aircraft, setting standards for airports, and protection of U.S. assets during the launch or re-entry of commercial space vehicles. Powers over neighboring international waters were delegated to the FAA by authority of the International Civil Aviation Organization.

Created in August 1958, the FAA replaced the former Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and later became an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation.
