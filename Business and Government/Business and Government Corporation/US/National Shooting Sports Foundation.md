The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF) is an [[United States of America|American]] national trade association for the firearms industry that is based in Newtown, Connecticut. Formed in 1961, the organization has more than 8,000 members:[1] firearms manufacturers, distributors, retailers, shooting ranges, sportsmen's clubs and media.[2][3]

The NSSF mission is "To promote, protect and preserve hunting and the shooting sports". In addition to promoting gun ownership,[4] the NSSF helps write safety and instruction standards.[5] The NSSF sponsors the annual Shooting Hunting and Outdoor Trade Show, the (SHOT Show).[3] The NSSF has advocated in favor of gun rights, including arguing against limits on high capacity magazines and the broad use of the term "assault weapon".[5] It has also supported legislation allowing concealed carry and has offered proposals to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating chemicals in ammunition as well as other sports such as fishing where lead is routinely used for its density.[4]
