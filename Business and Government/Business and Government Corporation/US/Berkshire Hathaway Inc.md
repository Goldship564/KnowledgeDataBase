Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (/ˈbɜːrkʃər/) is an [[United States of America|American]] multinational conglomerate holding company headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. Its main business and source of capital is insurance, from which it invests the float (the retained premiums) in a broad portfolio of subsidiaries, equity positions and other securities. The company has been overseen since 1965 by its chairman and CEO Warren Buffett and (since 1978) vice chairman Charlie Munger, who are known for their advocacy of value investing principles. Under their direction, the company's book value has grown at an average rate of 20%, compared to about 10% from the [[S&P 500]] index with dividends included over the same period, while employing large amounts of capital and minimal debt.[4]

The company's insurance brands include auto insurer GEICO and reinsurance firm General Re. Its non-insurance subsidiaries operate in diverse sectors such as confectionery, retail, railroads, home furnishings, machinery, jewelry, apparel, electrical power and natural gas distribution. Among its partially owned businesses are Pilot Flying J (80%),[5] Kraft Heinz Company (26.7%), American Express (18.8%), Paramount Global (15.4%),[6] Bank of America (11.9%), The Coca-Cola Company (9.32%) and Apple (5.57%).[7][8]

Berkshire is the seventh largest component of the S&P 500 index and the top-ranked company in the Forbes Global 2000, which takes into account both market value and fundamental data.[9] The company is one of the largest American-owned private employers in the United States. Its class A shares have the highest per-share price of any public company in the world, reaching $500,000 in March 2022, because Buffett chooses not to split the stock.[10]
