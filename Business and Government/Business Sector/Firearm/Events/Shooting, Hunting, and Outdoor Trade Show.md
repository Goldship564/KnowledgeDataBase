The SHOT Show , which is an acronym for "Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade Show", is an [[United States of America|American]] annual trade show for the shooting sports and hunting, outdoor recreation, and firearm manufacturing industries. The show is sponsored by the [[National Shooting Sports Foundation]] (NSSF)[2] and is the biggest event of the type in the world along with the IWA & OutdoorClassics ("IWA Nuremberg"), also held annually in Nuremberg, Germany.

The first ever SHOT Show was held in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1979. It used to rotate between Las Vegas, Nevada; Orlando, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana, and several other U.S. cities, although since 2010 it has taken place only in Las Vegas at the Sands Expo (renamed the Venetian Expo in September 2021), and is contracted to remain there through 2027. It attracted over 60,000 attendees to its 630,000 square feet (59,000 m2) of exhibition space in Las Vegas. It is among the top 25 trade shows in the US.[3]
