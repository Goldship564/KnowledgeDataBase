Borrowing allows governments to spend more on public services and projects than they raise in taxes. This is an attractive option to the government since raising tax is difficult.

Government can raise money by selling bonds, often to [[institutional investors]]. An investor buying a [[bond]] is lending the government money for an agreed term, and many bonds pay out interest at regular interval.
