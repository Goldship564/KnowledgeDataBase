A stock buyback occurs when the issuing company pays shareholders the market value per share and re-absorbs that portion of its ownership that was previously distributed among public and private investors

When a company repurchases its shares, it can purchase the stock on the open market or from its shareholders directly. In recent decades, share buybacks have overtaken dividends as a preferred way to return cash to shareholders. Though smaller companies may choose to exercise buybacks, blue-chip companies are much more likely to do so because of the costs involved.

#### Key takeaway 

- Companies do buybacks for various reasons, including company consolidation, equity value increase, and looking more financially attractive.

- The downside to buybacks is they are typically financed with debt, which can strain cash flow.

- Stock buybacks can have a mildly positive effect on the economy overall.


However, there are several reasons why it may be beneficial for a company to repurchase the shares.

- Including reducing the cost of capital
- Ownership consolidation, preserving stock prices, undervaluation
- Boosting its key financial ratio

 In Canada, it is called a normal-course issuer bid (NCIB) when Canadian companies buy back their shares.

### Downside of Stock Buybacks

A stock buyback affects a company's credit rating if it borrows money to repurchase the shares.
Many companies finance stock buybacks because the loan interest is tax-deductible.

However, debt obligations drain cash reserves, which are frequently needed when economic winds shift against a company.

For this reason, credit reporting agencies view such-financed stock buybacks negatively: They do not see boosting EPS or capitalizing on undervalued shares as a justification for taking on debt. A downgrade in credit rating often follows such a maneuver.9

Starting January 2023, stock buybacks by publicly-owned companies are subject to a 1% excise tax under specific conditions. The conditions that apply include:

- The tax does not apply if the repurchases are less than $1 million.
- New issues to the public or employees reduce the taxable amount of stocks repurchased.
- If the repurchase is treated as a dividend, the tax does not apply.
- Real estate investment trusts and regulated investment companies are exempt from the excise tax.
- The tax is not deductible.

## Stock Repurchase Effect on the Economy

Stock buybacks can have a mildly positive effect on the economy overall. They tend to have a much more direct and positive impact on the financial markets, as they lead to rising stock prices.

But in many ways, the stock market feeds into the real economy and vice versa. For example, research has shown that increases in the stock market positively affect consumer confidence, consumption, and major purchases, a phenomenon dubbed the wealth effect.
