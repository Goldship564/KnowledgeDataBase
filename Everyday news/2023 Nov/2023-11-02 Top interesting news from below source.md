Housing market have price continually rising and inventory shrinking. The reasons have range from anemic construction to student loan debt to investor buying up starter home. As  [[Interest Rate]] rises, cheap mortgages have become more and more rare thus created an affordability crisis.

University of California at Berkeley economist John Quigley in the 1980s identified the [[Lock-In Effect]], which he said was preventing [[United States of America|American]] from selling the home. Mortgage rates had spiked from 9% in 1978 to 18% in 1981, leaving millions of household with older mortgages paying what amounted to below-market rates. Buying a new home meant a more expensive load, adding substantial costs - a powerful disincentive to moving.

The [[Federal Reserve]]'s tightehing campign quickly cooled demand. It cooled supply even more, though, beacuse of Quigley's lock in effect. Most existing mortgage are below 4%, roughly half the cost of a new 30 year loan. The large spread is likely to reduce the rate at which homeowner move by more than a quarter over the next decade.

The trend will mostly affect would be buyers of their first homes, who will miss out on a key opportunity to use government-supported mortgages to build wealth. The economists point to other issue.: The lock in effect threatens to prevent younger owners from moving to larger homes and expanding their families while causing empty nesters to put off downsizing.
