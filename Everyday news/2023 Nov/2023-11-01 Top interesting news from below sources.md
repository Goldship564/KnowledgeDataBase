[[Federal Reserve]] Chair hinted the [[United States of America|U.S.]] [[Central Bank]] may now be finished with the most aggressive tightening cycle in four decades after it held off on raising rates for a second consecutive policy meeting.

"The question we're asking is: Should we hike more" Fed Chair told reporters during a press briefing after the decision. "Slowing down is giving us, I think, a better sense of how much more we need to do, if we need to do more."

The [[Federal Reserve|central bank]]'s policy-setting [[Federal Open Market Committee]] left its benchmark rate unchanged Wednesday in a range of 5.25% to 5.5.%, following a two-day meeting in Washington. Officals signaled in a post-meeting statement that a recent rise in longer-term treasury yeilds reduce the impetus to hike again, though they left open the door to another increase.

[[S&P 500]] closing more than 1% higher on the day. The 10-year [[United States of America|U.S.]] treasury yield tumbled below 4.75% for the first time in two weeks, extending move initially triggered in the morning by the Treasury Department's plan to slow the pace of increase in its long-term debt sales

[[Bank of Canada]] Governor said the [[natural rate of interest|neutral rate]] of interest is likely rising, and he wasn't fully confident in the central bank decision to leave their estimate of the measure unchanged earlier this year.

The comment suggest the [[Bank of Canada]] may view [[Interest Rate]], which are currently at 5%, the highest level in 22 years, as less restrictive, or having less bite, than previously believed.

Derek Holt, head of capital market economics at the [[Bank of Nova Scotia]] argued that monthly production-side [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] accounts, published on Tuesday, shouldn't be used to determine whether the economy has entered a recession.

He believe expenditure-based [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] is a more appropriate indicator because the data takes into account inventory cahnges as well as imports and exports.

While two straight quarters of contracting [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] constitute a "technical recession", it's not the only requirenment to determine a recession, a broader economic downturn that usually also entails protracted job losses and steadily rising unemployment

The last time [[Canada]] saw two consecutive quarters of contraction without a full declaration of a recession was in the first half of 2015 after the oil price collapsed, contributing in part to the defeat of Prime Minister Steven Harper's government in an election later that year.

Over the past year, Royal Bank has reported $229 million in adjusted net income from City National Bank, including a loss of $12 million in the Canadian bank's fiscal third quarter, which ran through July.

[[United States of America|U.S.]] job openings unexpectedly climbed in September for a second month, underscoring the persistent strength of labor demand in various pockets of the economy.

The September advance wasn't particularly large, it added to a more than half a million surge in the prior month. The last pickup was fueled by a jump in opening at accommodation and food services- points to the resilience of the labor market.

Some have question the reliabiliity of the JOLTS statistics given the survey's low response rate. That skepticism has been compounded by stories of employers "ghosting" jobseekers, a function of firm posting jobs they don't actually intend to fill.
