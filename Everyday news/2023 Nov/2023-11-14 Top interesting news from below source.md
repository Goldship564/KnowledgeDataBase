#### Key Takeaway

Hebei Gellec New Energy Science & Technology Co. is considering a Hong Kong initial public offering as early as next year after shelving previous plans for a listing in mainland China, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Chinese battery firm backed by BYD Co. has held initial talks with potential advisers for the share sale, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. An offering could raise at least a couple of hundred million dollars and value Gellec at about $2 billion, the people said.
Considerations are preliminary and details of the IPO including size and timeline could still change, according to the people. A representative for Gellec didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Founded in 2010, Gellec manufactures wet-process lithium-ion battery separators, its website shows. The Yongnian, Hebei province-based company withdrew its application for a 1.3 billion yuan ($178 million) A-share listing in September. Its revenue was 691 million yuan in the first half of last year, while its net income was 130 million yuan, according to the IPO prospectus. BYD owns more than a 2% stake in Gellec and contributed to over half of the firm’s revenue in the first six months of 2022.
First-time share sales in Asia, particularly in China, have been brought to close to a halt as regulatory hurdles and an economic slowdown weigh on investor sentiment. Chineseowned seed giant Syngenta Group last week decided to postpone its Shanghai IPO to the
end of next year, citing market volatility

#### Key Takeaway 

Goldman Sachs CEO made a statement regards to the economy of Hong Kong, he said the economy would improve and recover very soon,  he encourages investors and companies to invest funds into Hong Kong. However, on the same day after the statement were made.  It has leaked that Goldman Sachs is ready to sell the property, office building in Hong Kong. With the initial price of $1.3 billion HKD, Goldman Sachs offered $900 million HKD, to sell the property with a 30% cut.  

#### Analysis - Nicholas 

Not surprised the financial group is making a conflicting statement. Given with the information, it is suspected that Goldman Sachs is ready to reallocate resources, rather than staying in Hong Kong. Goldman Sachs has probably made a bearish forecast on Hong Kong economy and forsees the property market would continue to fall. Perhaps the recovered housing market cap would be lowever than the current market price. Hence, Goldman Sachs is willing to made a crushing 30% offer. In another source of information, Goldman Sachs made another statement about the IPO and economy market in India and mainland China would perform better in the future market, downgrading Hong Kong IPO market. Therefore, it is evident Goldman Sachs is prepared to allocate their resource in mainland and India. Specifically in the industry of artifical intelligence and technology.

#### Key Takeaway
[[United States of America|U.S.]] [[United States House of Representatives|House]] lawmakers overcame partisan animosity Tuesday to pass a temporary government funding bill that greatly lowers the risk of a shutdown even as it delay fights over [[Ukraine]] aid, border policies and deep cuts to federal programs.

A total of 209 [[Democratic Party|Democrat]] voted with 127 [[Republician Party|Republician]] in support of the measure, which needed a two-thirds majority to pass using an expedited process. 93 [[Republician Party|Republician]] voted against their new leader's plan, along with 2 [[Democratic Party|Democrat]]. 

The outcome proved time for the new house speaker to negotiate annual spending if the measure pass the [[United States Senate|Senate]].

#### Kenneth Review
The passing of a temporary bill is definitely a good sign that the new [[United States House of Representatives|House]] speaker is up for the job. However, it seems like he would not be able to united the [[Republician Party|GOP]]. From the vote result, he would need a good amount of democrat support to pass the temporary government funding bill where a good amount of [[Republician Party|Republician]] did not support his bill. 

Also The bill passed does not contain any of the [[Democratic Party|Democrat]] and [[Republician Party|Republician]] wish list, thus this bill is just a temporary bandage to buy more time for him to negotiate a new spending. With vast amount of [[Republician Party|Republician]] not support this bill. It will be hard for the new leader to negotiate a bill that will everyone in his party happy while gaining support from his opposition party.

>- [[Hamas]]

#### Key Takeaway
Israel's military said it is undertaking an operation at a major [[Palestine#Gaza|Gaza]] hospital it accuses [[Hamas]] of using as a command center.

[[Israel Defense Force]] are 'carrying out a percise and targeted operation against [[Hamas]] in a specific area in the Shifa Hospital'. The scale of [[Israel]]'s move wasn't immediately clear. The [[Israel Defense Force|IDF]] said its forces included medical teams and Arabic speakers.

#### Kenneth Analysis
[[Israel Defense Force|IDF]] have repeated accused teh Shifa Hospital as the front line headquarter of [[Hamas]]. Thus such attack is always predictable. If what [[Israel]] claim is true and their operation is a success. This can cripple [[Hamas]] command structure thus eliminate a huge risk [[Hamas]] post in Gaza. 

That being said, an operation against a hospital would certainly generate outcry from [[Levant|middle east]] countries specificly [[Iran]]. An toothless [[Hamas]] would greatly increase [[Israel]] control of its region thus decrease [[Iran]] influence. Would [[Iran]] allow that or are they going to intervene? And if they do intervene, how are they going to do that and are other arabic countries going to let this happen. The next few days would be crucial to get answers for these questions.

### Goldman Downgrades Hong Kong-Traded China Stocks, Raises India

>- [[India]]

#### Key Takeaway 

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its recommendation on Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong due to modest earnings growth, while maintaining a bullish view for shares traded on the mainland.

China’s industry is going through a rebalancing toward “areas of higher productivity and greater self-sufficiency,” which includes technology theme such as artificial intelligence, strategists including Timothy Moe wrote in a note. These opportunities “are more widely present in the onshore market,” they added.

The Wall Street bank expects 10% earnings growth in 2024 for members of the MSCI China Index and 11% for those on the CSI 300, similar to what they project for this year. That’s because while the drag from the housing crisis may moderate, a higher base from the post-Covid demand recovery will present a hurdle for bigger profit gains.

The firm has downgraded its target on Chinese benchmarks several times in 2023 amid the market’s lackluster performance. In the latest report, Goldman remained overweight on Chinese onshore shares. Sectors related to themes including AI, new infrastructure, and state-owned enterprises reforms might have a good run, they said.

Morgan Stanley also highlighted its preference for A-shares in a note dated Nov. 12, while staying equal-weight on China overall.

“The hurdles ahead to a sustainable China equity market recovery are still high, with mounting macro pressure on earnings coupled with currency weakness,” analysts including Laura Wang wrote in the note.

2024 might be “a defining year” for China to start systematically tackling long-term structural challenges, which have deterred further long-term allocation at the current juncture, the analysts wrote. They expect increases of 5% and 7% for the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index and CSI 300 Index by the end of 2024 from Nov. 8 levels.

India Potential

Goldman strategists upgraded India to overweight. The country is expected to see “the best structural growth prospects in the region” with mid-teens earnings growth over the next two years, they wrote.

The market’s strategic appeal, particularly given its largely domestically driven growth, offers investors a wide array of alpha-generating themes, including make-in-India, large cap compounders and mid-cap multibaggers, they said.

Morgan Stanley strategists also said India remains a top pick heading into 2024.

#### Key Takeaway 

This year, amid a deepening youth joblessness crisis in the world's second-largest economy, even remote rural positions have seen intense competition from young Chinese with diplomas from top universities, graduates and economists say.

The government sees employment as key to pacifying China's most pessimistic decades, while graduates gaining even limited work experience can also benefit their future employers if the economy recovers, analysts say.


#### Analysis - Nicholas 

Given with the recent economic downfall of China and Hong Kong. Graduates are having an immense diffculty in finding a decent job in the current market. As they are openings in government offices, graduates rather choose offical jobs over private markets. This is trivial as official jobs are more stable and less intense labor involved. Similar trends could be observed in Hong Kong. Gradutes rather live under unemployment than to work in labor intense positions. Shirfting the supply to government jobs.
