#### Key takeaway 

Total net profits at Japan’s three megabanks surged to 1.8 trillion yen ($12 billion) in the April-September period, buoyed by interest rate hikes overseas and the weak yen, their interim earnings reports showed.

The total reached a record high level, and two of the megabanks are now forecasting record net profits for the full year.

[[Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc (MUFG)]]  posted a record half-year net profit of 927.2 billion yen, nearly quadruple the figure from the same period last year. The rise was partly due to expanded lending in the United States, where interest rates are rising, the bank said. For the full year, MUFG is forecasting a record net profit of 1.3 trillion yen.

The operating profit at [[Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (SMFG)]] dropped because of higher foreign currency procurement costs due to the weak yen, but its net profit still rose slightly to a record high for the half-year period. The increase was attributed to strong lending both domestically and internationally, and the weak yen. SMFG raised its full-year net profit forecast from 820 billion yen to a record 920 billion yen.


[[Mizuho Financial Group Inc.]] reported a more than 20 percent increase in net profit from April-September period last year.The bank benefited from strong lending in the United States and Europe, and a significant increase in investment earnings from the rising value of Japanese stocks.
Mizuho revised its full-year net profit forecast upward to 640 billion yen.
However, there are still some concerns.

“The European economy is already deteriorating, and there are uncertainties about the future of the United States,” said Masahiro Kihara, president of Mizuho. “In China, the worsening real estate market is affecting consumption.”

**RISING INTEREST RATES IN SIGHT**

Japanese banks are eagerly watching moves by the Bank of Japan, which has long maintained an ultra-loose monetary policy, including long-term interest rates hovering around zero.

But following the rapid rate hikes in the United States last year, Japan’s long-term interest rates also rose.

The BOJ virtually raised the cap on long-term interest rates to 1 percent in July this year and further loosened its grip in October to allow the rates to rise beyond the 1 percent line.

Financial institutions have raised fixed adjust its monetary easing and long-term deposit rates.
The central bank is expected to not only further adjust its monetary easing policy but also fully shift away from the policy. Much of the lending by financial institutions is short-term and linked to the short-term interest rates that the BOJ has set to negative.

The three megabanks each estimate their earnings will increase by 30 billion yen to 50 billion yen if the BOJ ends the [[Negative interest rate policy]]

In preparation for interest rate hikes, the three megabanks are focusing on collecting deposits, the source of their lending.

In March, SMFG released a financial services app called Olive for retail customers. It plans to use the app to increase the number of accounts through points-awarding campaigns and other methods.

“We will collect deposits cost-effectively in preparation for a world with interest rates,” Ito said.

However, companies may become more cautious about borrowing if interest rates rise.
“If we support corporate growth and structural reforms, there will be demand for funds,” Kihara said.

###  Japan seeks new way to collect taxes on overseas mobile games

#### Key Takeaway 

Since some international companies are not paying consumption taxes on revenue from online games and other mobile apps, the government plans to start collecting those taxes from platform operators instead.

In a report published Nov. 14, an expert panel under the Finance Ministry called for an early introduction of a new system, similar to that used in Europe and other countries, to collect the consumption tax from platform operators such as Google LLC and Apple Inc. Under Japan’s current tax system, app and game companies are responsible for paying the consumption tax on app sales themselves. However, many overseas companies are believed to have failed to pay these taxes.

Since many of these companies don’t have a base in Japan and all transactions--from concluding contracts and distributing games to receiving payments--are completed in platform operators’ app stores, it is difficult for Japanese tax authorities to conduct investigations, gather information and collect taxes.

This issue has been viewed as unfair to domestic companies, which have to pay consumption taxes.

Under the new system to be considered by government and ruling coalition officials, platform operators that distribute overseas mobile applications through their app stores would be obligated to pay the consumption tax on behalf of overseas companies, sources said.

The report also said that the new system would only target overseas companies, since domestic companies already pay taxes correctly under the current system because they are required to file corporate and other taxes in addition to the consumption tax.

The domestic market for mobile apps continues to grow annually, led by online games, and is expected to expand from $6.8 billion (1.027 trillion yen) in 2015 to $38.7 billion in 2024.

In a rare case, the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau has ordered a Luxembourg-based subsidiary of U.S. Epic Games Inc. to pay an estimated 3.5 billion yen in back taxes and penalties for failing to pay the consumption tax over three years on items Japanese users purchased to play the online shooter game Fortnite

#### Key Takeaway

Japan’s economy slipped into a contraction in the third quarter, decreasing at an annual pace of 2.1% as consumption and investments shrank, the government reported Wednesday.

Real gross domestic product, which measures the total value of a nation’s products and services, fell 0.5% in the July-September period for the world’s third largest economy, the Cabinet Office said. That would produce a 2.1% drop if the quarter’s performance continued for a full 12 months.

The downturn came after the economy grew a revised 3.7% in the first quarter and a revised 4.5% in the second quarter on an annualized basis, according to the government figures.

The third quarter’s performance was far worse than what had been expected, according to the financial services company ING, which had forecast an annual contraction of 0.5%.

#### Key Takeaway

China’s October economic activity perked up as industrial output grew at a faster pace and retail sales growth beat expectations, an encouraging sign for an economy still showing significant pockets of weakness despite a flurry of support measures.

The world’s second-biggest economy has struggled to mount a strong post-COVID recovery as a deepening property crisis, local government debt risks, slow global growth and geopolitical tensions have dented momentum.

China’s industrial output grew 4.6% in October year-on-year, accelerating from the 4.5% pace seen in September, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Wednesday, beating expectations for a 4.4% increase in a Reuters poll. It also marked the strongest growth since April.

Retail sales, a gauge of consumption, rose 7.6% in October, quickening from a 5.5% gain in September and hitting the fastest growth since May. Analysts had expected retail sales to grow 7.0% due to the low base effect in 2022 when COVID curbs disrupted consumers and businesses.
