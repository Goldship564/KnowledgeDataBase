[[UBS Group AG|UBS]] buy its former rival [[Credit Suisse Group AG]] during March 2023 to prevent one of the major bank in [[Swiss Confederation|Switzerland]] collapse. Since then investor of [[UBS Group AG|UBS]] have backed [[Sergio Pietro Ermotti|Sergio Ermotti]], [[UBS Group AG|UBS]] former [[Chief Executive Officier|CEO]] to use the most wanted portion to solidify [[UBS Group AG|UBS]].

[[Sergio Pietro Ermotti|Sergio Ermotti]] mentioned his mission coming back is not just to integrate the bank but prepare [[UBS Group AG|UBS]] for the next chapter. He plan to use [[Credit Suisse Group AG|Credit Suisse]] to bulletproof [[UBS Group AG|UBS]] as the undisputed gloval wealth champion.

For several days each January, the largest firearms industry event "[[Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade Show|SHOT Show]]" will happen near the Las Vegas Strip. Although the industry that run the "[[Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade Show|SHOT Show]]" is the [[National Shooting Sports Foundation]], this was a [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] operation. In 2013, Commerce agreed to start hosting people from around the world at [[Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade Show|SHOT Show]] as part of its International Buyer Program, an effort to boost exports of various [[United States of America|U.S.]] products by promoting stateside trade show. The [[National Shooting Sports Foundation|NSSF]] consider the move a "crucial" step in a multiyear plan to being in more oversea business.

With this approach, the global network of Foreign Commercial Service employees has effectively become a combination [[Shooting, Hunting, and Outdoor Trade Show|SHOT Show]] travel agency, gun industry promotion service and deal brokage. In recent years, Commerce employees overseas have organized group trips to Las Vegas from South America, Africa, Asia and the [[Levant|middle east]].  Invitees of the [[United States of America|U.S.]] government detailed how commerce officials booked flights and hotels for Guatemalan firearms shops, scored discounted Cirque du Soleil tickets for Brazilian importers, provided matchmaking services for Peruvian buyers and helped rush through a visa approval for a politican in Brazil's "bullet caucus".

The partnership has been particularly successful in Latin America. In peru, a lobbying group for hunter spent almost a decade mentoring and financing advocate who helped mold gun-rights legislation in the image of [[United States of America|U.S.]] laws. This have both benefits and set back like the country being influence by the program elected a new governemnt official that would limit gun right. 

The important take away is the partisanship of federal worker are being question. Both [[National Shooting Sports Foundation|NSSF]] and [[National Rifle Association of America|NRA]] are heavy [[Republician Party|republican]] lobbier. However, both party would be benefit by the act as it boost [[United States of America|U.S.]] export. Thus there are policies that introduce by [[Democratic Party|Democrat]] that benefits the firmarm industry such as cutting red tap and transferring some firearms from under the state department to the commerce department. Trump administration have push the policy out but [[Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.|biden]] administration have not roll back those policies even he mentioned fighting [[United States of America|U.S.]] gun violence is a key issue.

The situation in the [[Levant|middle east]] is looking more and more similar to post [[Septmenber 11th terrorist attack|September 11th]] in the united state. A lot of observer fear that this might mean [[United States of America|U.S.]] would be involved involuntarily to the [[Levant|middle east]] after pulling out from Afghanistan.

The price of money is going up after more than three decades. Take the yield on a 10 year [[United States of America|U.S.]] Treasury note, which has surged towards 5% in recent weeks, pulling up the cost of mortgages and corporate loans in its wake. At fist it looks like a blip but it have turned into a bond market rout. Which could explain by investor views on money have changed, and that money is going to stay expensive for a while and not just beacuse it will take long than expected for [[Federal Reserve]] to wrestle down inflation.

For economic wonks, the price of money that balance saving and investment while keeping inflation rate down is called the '[[natural rate of interest]]', or r-star and its hard to pin down. Which leads to a lot of scholar to expressed skepticism about its usefulness as a guide for [[Monetary Policy]]. Recent search lead to some economist believe that we have reached an inflexion point and the era of cheap money is over. However that view is far from unanimous, some believe that inflation will not last but low rate will. 

Bloomberg created a model to find out the reason for the drop in natural rate.
- Weaker economic growth
- Shifting demographics
