## Overview
China's former Premier [[Li Keqiang]] has suddenly died less than a year after stepping down from overseeing the world's second largest economy.

Li suffered a sudden heart attack on Thursday and passed away in the early hours of Friday (Oct 27, 2023) in Shanghai after all rescue efforts failed, state broadcaster [[China Central Television]] reported. He was 68

## Why I think this is important
Li Keqiang have been remarked by a lot of outside observer to be sideline by [[Xi Jinping]] ([source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-premier-li-keqiang-xi-jinping-11652277107)). Some speculate this is due to his view in economic reform and liberalization(aka more open to other country)([source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/11/a-defeated-person-sidelined-by-xi-chinas-li-keqiang-bows-out-as-premier)). Where Xi Jinping focus on [self sustaining](https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3159522/xi-jinping-says-china-must-be-self-sufficient-energy-food-and).

Although Li Keqiang have been sideline from the central power since March, his death and the current political climiate in China means [[People's Republic of China|China]] would likely continued on the route of relying state ownership and be less open to the foreign world.
