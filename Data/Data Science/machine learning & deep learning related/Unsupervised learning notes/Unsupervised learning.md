The [[Training set]] is unlabeled. The system will need to learn without a teacher

## Example and uses
[Visualization algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing) are also good example of unsupervised learning algorithms: 
you feed them a lot of complex and unlabeled data, and they output a 2D or 3D representation of your data that can be easily be plotted

[[Anomaly detection and novelty detection|Anomaly detection]] is also another important application. E.g. detecting unusual credit car transactions to prevent fraud. Catching manufacturing defects.

[[Association rule learning]] can help providing insights in large amount of data
