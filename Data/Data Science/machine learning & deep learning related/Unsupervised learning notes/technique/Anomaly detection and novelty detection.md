## Anomaly detection

The system is shown mostly normal instances during [[Training set|training]] so they recognize them. When it see a new instances, the system can tell if the new instances is normal behavior or not.

E.g. if you have a thousand of dogs, and 1 % of them are Chihuahuas, then anomaly detection might treat new Chihuahuas as anomaly.
## Novelty detection

Aim to detect new instances that look different from all instances in the [[Training set]]. This require a very "clean" [[Training set]].

E.g. if you have a thousand of dogs, and 1 % of them are Chihuahuas, then novelty detection should not treat new Chihuahuas as novelties.


## One-class SVM


## Isolation Forest
