A test data set is a data set that is independent of the [[Training set|training data]] set, but that follows the same probability distribution as the [[Training set|training data]] set. If a model fit to the [[Training set|training data]] set also fits the test data set well, minimal [[Bad Algorithms#Overfitting|Overfitting]] has taken place. A better fitting of the [[Training set|training data]] set as opposed to the test data set usually points to [[Bad Algorithms#Overfitting|over-fitting]]. 

A test set is therefore a set of examples used only to assess the performance (i.e. [[The machine learning landscape#Instance-Based versus Model-Based Learning|Generalization]]) of a fully specified classifier.[9][10] To do this, the final model is used to predict classifications of examples in the test set. Those predictions are compared to the examples' true classifications to assess the model's [[Accuracy]].[11]
