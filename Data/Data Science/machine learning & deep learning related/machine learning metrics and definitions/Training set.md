A training data set is a [data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataset "Dataset") of examples used during the learning process and is used to fit the parameters (e.g., weights) of, for example, a [classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_(machine_learning) "Classifier (machine learning)")

For classification tasks, a supervised learning algorithm looks at the training data set to determine, or learn, the optimal combinations of variables that will generate a good predictive model.[11] The goal is to produce a trained (fitted) model that generalizes well to new, unknown data.[12] The fitted model is evaluated using “new” examples from the held-out datasets (validation and test datasets) to estimate the model’s accuracy in classifying new data.[5] To reduce the risk of issues such as over-fitting, the examples in the validation and test datasets should not be used to train the model.[5]

Most approaches that search through training data for empirical relationships tend to overfit the data, meaning that they can identify and exploit apparent relationships in the training data that do not hold in general.

## Sample

Each record or line in a training data set

## Label

Training set that contain the desired results. 

E.g. Spam filter, the user would labeled spam email.

## Predictors

A set of features of the record. 

### Predictors of a car
- mileage
