The system is incapable of learning incrementally. It must be [[Training|trained]] using all the avaliable data. 

## Normal practice
- [[Training]] done offline
- After model is [[Training|trained]], it is lauched into production and runs without learning anymore
- Also called **Offline learning**
- To replace the system, you will need to stop the old system and replace it with the new one.

## Drawback
- Take a lot of time and computing resource
- Not reactive
