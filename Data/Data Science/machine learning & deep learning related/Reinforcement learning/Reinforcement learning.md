The learning system, called an [[agent]]. Can observed the environment, select and perform actions, and get reward in return. It must then learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a [[policy]], to get the most reward over time.

## Example

- Many robots implement reinforcement learning algorithms to learn how to walk. 
- [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/about) [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo) program is also a good example of reinforce learning.
	- It learned its winning policy by analyzing millions of games, and then playing many games against itself
