Build a model of [[Training set#Label|lablled]] examples and then use that model to make predictions. 

## Normal practice

- You studied the data
- You selected a model
- You [[Training|trained]] it on the [[Training set|training data]] 
- You  applied the model to make predictions on new cases, hoping the model will generalize well

## What if the data does not generalize well?

You might need to use more [[Training set#Predictors|attributes]], get more or better quality [[Training set|training data]], or perhaps select a [[The machine learning landscape#Types of Machine Learning Systems|more powerful model]].
