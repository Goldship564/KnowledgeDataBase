## What are Business Rules
A business rule is a statement that imposes some form of constraint on a specific aspect of the [[database]]. 

Some example are 
- Elements within a field specification for a particular field
- The characteristics of a given relationship

You base a business rules on the way the organization perceive and uses its data, which you determine from the manner in which the organization functions or conducts its business

An important aspect of any design process is making choices. In database design, you must choose which data to store in the database. You wouldn't necessarily want or need to store every last piece of data the organization might possibly use. The data you finally choose to store and how you decide to store it will be determined by the way the organization uses its data. 

To guide those choices you will be required to make during the [[Database]] design process, you need a formal statement of the organization's business rules. These rules will influence a wide variety of [[database]] issue such as:
- what you collect and store
- The manner you define and establish relationships
- The types of information that the database can provide
- The security and confidentially of the data itself
