ASEAN,[c] an abbreviation for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,[d][13] is a political and economic union of 10 states in Southeast Asia. Together, its member states represent a population of over 600 million over a land area of 4.5 million km2 (1.7 million sq mi).[14] The bloc generated a purchasing power parity (PPP) [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) of around US$10.2 trillion in 2022, constituting approximately 6.5% of global GDP (PPP).[9] ASEAN member states include some of the fastest growing economies in the world.

The primary objectives as stated by the association are[15] "to accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region", and "to promote regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries in the region and adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter." The bloc has broadened its objectives beyond economic and social spheres, aiming to emulate the European Union by establishing a shared security regime.

ASEAN engages with other supranational entities in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond: it is a major partner of the [[United Nations|UN]], SCO, PA, GCC, MERCOSUR, CELAC, and ECO,[16] It hosts diplomatic missions throughout the world,[17][18][19][20] maintaining a global network of relationships, and is considered by many to be a global powerhouse,[21][22] and even the central forum for cooperation in the region.[23] Its success has become the driving force of some of the largest trade blocs in history, including APEC and RCEP.[24][25][26][27][28][29]
