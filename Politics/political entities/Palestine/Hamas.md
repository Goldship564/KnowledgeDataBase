Hamas (UK: /həˈmæs/ hə-MASS, US: /həˈmɑːs/ ⓘ hə-MAHSS;[58] Arabic: حماس, romanized: Ḥamās, IPA: [ħaˈmaːs]),[59] officially the Islamic Resistance Movement (حركة المقاومة الإسلامية Ḥarakat al-Muqāwamah al-ʾIslāmiyyah), is a Sunni Islamist[60] political and military organization governing the [[Palestine#Gaza|Gaza Strip ]] of the Palestinian territories.[61] Headquartered in Gaza City, it also has a presence in the West Bank (the larger of the two Palestinian territories), in which its secular rival Fatah exercises control. Hamas is widely considered to be the "dominant political force" within the Palestinian territories.[62][63][64]

In 1987, after the outbreak of the First Intifada against Israel, Hamas was founded by Palestinian imam and activist Ahmed Yassin. It emerged out of his Mujama al-Islamiya, which had been established in Gaza in 1973 as an Islamic charity involved with the Egypt-based Muslim Brotherhood.[22] Hamas became increasingly involved in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict by the late 1990s;[65] it opposed the Israel–PLO Letters of Mutual Recognition as well as the Oslo Accords, which saw Fatah renounce "the use of terrorism and other acts of violence" and recognize [[Israel]] in pursuit of a two-state solution. Hamas continued to advocate Palestinian armed resistance, won the 2006 Palestinian legislative election,[66] gaining a majority in the Palestinian Legislative Council,[67] and took control of the Gaza Strip from Fatah following a civil war in 2007.[68][69] Since then, it has run Gaza as a de facto autocratic and one-party state.[70][71][72]

While historically seeking an Islamic Palestinian state over the combined territory of Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip (rejecting the two-state solution),[73][74] Hamas began negotiating with Israel and the 1967 borders in the agreements it signed with Fatah in 2005, 2006 and 2007.[75] In 2017 Hamas released a new charter that supported a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders without recognizing Israel.[76][77][78][79] Hamas's repeated offers of a truce (for a period of 10—100 years[80]) based on the 1967 borders are seen by many as being consistent with a two-state solution,[81][82][83][84] while others state that Hamas retains the long-term objective of establishing one state in the former Mandate Palestine.[85][86] Under the ideological principles of Islamism, it promotes Palestinian nationalism in an Islamic context; it has pursued a policy of jihad (armed struggle) against Israel.[c] It has a social service wing, Dawah, and a military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades.[d][e] The Hamas government has pushed through changes that gave greater influence to Islamic law in the Gaza Strip. Since the mid-1990s,[22] Hamas has gained widespread popularity within Palestinian society for its anti-Israeli stance.[90][91] The group's attacks, including suicide bombings against civilian targets and indiscriminate rocket attacks, have led many countries and academics[60] to designate Hamas a terrorist organization.[92][93][51] A 2018 attempt to condemn Hamas for "acts of terror" at the United Nations failed.[f]

The Gaza Strip is currently under blockade. Israel and Hamas have fought a number of wars there, including in 2008–09, in 2012 and in 2014. In the 2023 war, Hamas launched "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood" and its fighters broke through the Gaza barrier, attacked Israeli military bases, massacred civilians and took civilian and soldier hostages back to Gaza.[95][96][62] The attack has been described as the biggest setback of Israeli military since the 1973 war. In response, Israel began its aerial bombardment of Gaza and announced its intention to destroy Hamas.[97] The EU and the US have called for the elimination of Hamas.[98][99][100]
