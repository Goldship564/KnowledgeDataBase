The United Arab Emirates (Arabic: الإمارات العربية المتحدة, romanized: al-ʾImārāt al-ʿArabiyya l-Muttaḥida;[b] UAE), or simply the Emirates (Arabic: الإمارات, romanized: al-ʾImārāt), is a country in West Asia, in the Middle East. It is located at the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula and shares borders with Oman and Saudi Arabia, while also having maritime borders in the Persian Gulf with Qatar and Iran. Abu Dhabi is the nation's capital, while Dubai, the most populous city, is an international hub.

The United Arab Emirates is an elective monarchy formed from a federation of seven emirates, consisting of Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain.[14] Each emirate is an absolute monarchy governed by a ruler, and together the rulers form the Federal Supreme Council. The members of the Federal Supreme Council elect a president (as of 14 May 2023, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan)[15] and vice president (Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan) from among their members. In practice, the ruler of Abu Dhabi serves as president while the ruler of Dubai is vice president and also prime minister.[16] In 2020, the country had a population of 9.28 million.[17] Emiratis are estimated to form 11.6% of the UAE population with the remaining being expatriates.[18] As of 2023, the United Arab Emirates has an estimated population of 9.97 million.[18]

Islam is the official religion and Arabic is the official language. The United Arab Emirates' oil and natural gas reserves are the world's sixth and seventh-largest, respectively.[19][20] Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the country's first president, oversaw the development of the Emirates by investing oil revenues into healthcare, education, and infrastructure.[21] The United Arab Emirates has the most diversified economy among the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council.[22] In the 21st century, the country has become less reliant on oil and gas and is economically focusing on tourism and business. The UAE is considered a middle power. It is a member of the United Nations, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OPEC, Non-Aligned Movement, World Trade Organization and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). The UAE is also a dialogue partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation. It is among the first Arab countries expected to join BRICS on 1 January 2024 (along with Egypt and Saudi Arabia).[23]

Human rights organisations consider the UAE substandard on human rights, citing reports of government critics being imprisoned and tortured, families harassed by the state security apparatus, and cases of forced disappearances.[24][25] Individual rights such as the freedoms of assembly, association, the press, expression, and religion are also severely repressed.[26]
